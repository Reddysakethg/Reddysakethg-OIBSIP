## Project Overview

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, you'll find the code and documentation for three data science projects I've completed:

1. **Iris Flower Classification**: This project focuses on the classification of Iris flowers into different species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on their sepal and petal dimensions. It employs machine learning algorithms to make accurate predictions and provides insights into the dataset.

2. **Unemployment Analysis**: In this project, I analyze unemployment data, exploring trends, patterns, and factors affecting unemployment rates. Various data visualization techniques and statistical analysis are used to gain a comprehensive understanding of the unemployment landscape.

3. **Car Price Prediction**: The Car Price Prediction project aims to predict the prices of cars based on their features such as make, model, year, mileage, and more. Machine learning models are trained on historical car price data to make accurate price predictions for new or used cars.

## Repository Structure

Here's a brief overview of the repository's structure:

- **Iris-Flower-Classification**: This directory contains the code and documentation for the Iris Flower Classification project. You can explore the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts used for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

- **Unemployment-Analysis**: In this directory, you'll find notebooks or scripts related to the Unemployment Analysis project. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical modeling code.

- **Car-Price-Prediction**: The Car Price Prediction project is stored in this directory. You can access the code and documentation related to data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Getting Started

If you're interested in exploring any of these projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the specific project directory of your choice (e.g., `Iris-Flower-Classification`, `Unemployment-Analysis`, or `Car-Price-Prediction`).

3. Open the project's README and follow the instructions for setup and usage.

## Requirements

Each project may have its own set of requirements and dependencies. Please refer to the README within each project directory for detailed information on how to install the necessary libraries and set up the environment.
